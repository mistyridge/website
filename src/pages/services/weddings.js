              review="Misty Ridge was the perfect venue for our small wedding! Allen and Kathryn were gracious hosts who made every effort to make our family feel at home and create the right vibe for our special day. The venue features very comfortable themed rooms (nice beds!), spa-like bathrooms, absolutely stunning scenery and walking trails, an abundance of outdoor gathering spaces, and the truly magical “Turtle Hill” where our ceremony was held. Allen and Kathryn bring a very special energy to the property, and also make the best breakfasts ever! We are so grateful to them for hosting us, and look forward to staying at their BnB again soon"

              review="My husband and I had our Wedding at Kathryn and Allen's property on July 31, 2021.
              Everything turned out so perfectly, and so beautiful. The flowers, landscape, scenery, and wildlife are something we don't often see living in the city. We couldn't have had the wedding of our dreams, without Misty Ridge Retreat B&B.
              Kathryn and Allen worked with us at different times throughout the planning process to figure out where to place tents, where to have the ceremony, where to put the dance floor, etc. They allowed us to use one of there own tents, so we didn't have to rent an additional one through the rental company. In addition, our MC did not have a necessary cord for the microphone, and Allen very kindly lent us one of his own.
              We had our ceremony on Turtle Hill, which is the most romantic place to be. The view is breathtaking. There is an alter on Turtle Hill, and our florist simply added florals and greenery. This created the most magical place to be and we feel honoured that this is where we were able to commit our lives to each other."
