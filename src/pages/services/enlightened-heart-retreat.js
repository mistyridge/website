              <p>
                I'm a Certified Sound Healing Practitioner and take pride in
                providing supportive and inclusive environments in which
                positive change and healing can unfold. The use of technical
                knowledge and intuition help to inform the planning of each of
                my sessions, catering to the needs of the group or individual I
                am serving. A variety of techniques and instruments are used in
                my sessions; including crystal bowls, Tibetan bowls, drums,
                tingshas, tuning forks, chimes, mantra chanting, gongs,
                monochord, and more. I often weave aspects of astrology,
                meditation, journaling, Pranayama (breathing techniques),
                Mudras, and oracle readings into my sound offerings. Thank you
                for taking the time to read my story. I would be truly honoured
                to share this modality with you as you move through whatever
                path or journey you currently find yourself on.
