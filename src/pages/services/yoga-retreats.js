                If you are looking to lead, host, or attend a yoga retreat in
                Alberta, this is the perfect spot for you! Our B&B sits on 6.5
                acres of land which is nestled in the rolling foothills of
                Alberta and we can hold up to 50 guests (9 overnighters) on our
                location! Our bed and breakfast includes delicious morning meals
                and we can accommodate various food allergies for you and your
                yoga students. We strive to make your yoga retreat a safe and
                positive experience and the on-site B&B accommodation is
                comfortable and clean, and is in close proximity to Calgary. Our

              review="I recently led a retreat for 14 womxn at the Misty Ridge Retreat B & B. The beautiful outdoor scenery and the space they created for our yoga Practices were perfect for our group. Kathryn provided delicious morning meals that accommodated our various food allergies and it was evident that much care had gone into insuring that our retreat was a safe and positive experience. The on-site accommodation is comfortable, clean and beautiful and being in close proximity to Calgary, we were able to have students commute in to the retreat as well. This was a perfect setting, well enough removed from the city to properly relax but we'll within reach of everything we needed! Highly recommend and already booking for next year!"

              review="I went for a retreat/workshop led by Allen & Kathryn Kessler, the hosts and owners of Misty Ridge Retreat B&B. Misty Ridge is located in the rolling foothills a bit southwest of Calgary and is a fantastic place to connect with nature. The bedrooms are sizeable (bigger than some hotel/motel rooms I've stayed in!) and have very comfortable beds which are adjustable by remote control. The dining room features large windows that offer a view of the foothills and wildlife. It's a fantastic place to relax.
              The workshop was excellent and well-led. I'm still processing what I've learned."
